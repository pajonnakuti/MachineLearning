# Time Series Forecasting with NeuralForecast

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains such as finance, retail, energy, and more. Accurate predictions enable better decision-making and planning. Traditional statistical methods like ARIMA and exponential smoothing have been widely used, but with the advent of deep learning, neural network-based models have shown significant improvements in forecasting accuracy.

[NeuralForecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast) is a Python library designed to simplify time series forecasting using deep learning models. It provides a unified interface for training, evaluating, and deploying state-of-the-art neural network models for time series forecasting.

## Key Features of NeuralForecast

- **Pre-built Models**: Includes implementations of popular deep learning models like LSTMs, GRUs, TCNs, and more.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with popular data manipulation libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
- **Scalability**: Supports large datasets and can be run on GPUs for faster training.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to define custom models and loss functions.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides a variety of metrics to evaluate model performance, such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

## Installation

You can install NeuralForecast using pip:

```bash
pip install neuralforecast
```
## Data Preparation

NeuralForecast expects your data to be in a specific format. It should be a Pandas DataFrame with two columns:

- `ds`: Datestamp (datetime)
- `y`: Target variable (numeric)

## Model Selection

NeuralForecast offers a variety of models, including:

- **NBEATS:** A deep learning architecture designed specifically for time series forecasting.
- **NHITS:** A model that leverages hierarchical interpolation for improved accuracy.
- **TFT:** Temporal Fusion Transformer, a model capable of handling complex temporal patterns and exogenous variables.

You can choose the model that best suits your data and forecasting needs.

## Training and Forecasting

Here's a basic example of how to train a model and generate forecasts:
```bash
Load your data into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

Initialize the model
model = NBEATS(input_size=24, h=12) # Adjust parameters as needed

Initialize NeuralForecast
nf = NeuralForecast(models=[model], freq='D') # Adjust frequency as needed

Fit the model
nf.fit(df)

Generate forecasts
forecast = nf.predict()
```bash
## Evaluation

NeuralForecast provides tools for evaluating forecast accuracy using metrics such as:

- **RMSE:** Root Mean Squared Error
- **MAE:** Mean Absolute Error
- **MAPE:** Mean Absolute Percentage Error

You can use these metrics to compare different models and select the best one for your task.

## Visualization

You can visualize the forecasts using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. Here's an example using Matplotlib:

Assuming your forecast DataFrame is called 'forecast'
```bash
dates = forecast['ds'] forecast_values = forecast['NBEATS'] # Replace with your model name
plt.plot(dates, forecast_values, label='Forecast') plt.plot(df['ds'], df['y'], label='Actual') plt.legend() plt.show()
```bash

## Conclusion

NeuralForecast is a powerful and versatile library for time series forecasting. It offers a wide range of models, a user-friendly interface, and tools for evaluation and visualization. By leveraging NeuralForecast, you can build accurate and reliable forecasting models for your specific needs.
