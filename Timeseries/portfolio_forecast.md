# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

This notebook explores various methods for analyzing and forecasting time series data, specifically focusing on monthly trends from 2020 to 2025 (and beyond).

## Data and Initial Visualization

The data represents monthly values (in Lakhs ₹) for a specific metric. It's initially visualized using a line chart to observe the overall trend and seasonality.

## Forecasting Methods

### 1. Linear Regression

- A simple linear regression model is used to forecast values for 2025 based on the trend from previous years.
- Forecasted values are visualized using a bar chart.

### 2. Econometric Forecasting (ARIMA)

- An ARIMA model (order: 1, 1, 1) is applied to the time series data to forecast values for 2025–2027.
- The historical data and forecast are plotted together for comparison.

### 3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Network

- An LSTM neural network is trained on the historical data to capture temporal patterns.
- It forecasts values for 2025–2027, visualized alongside the historical data.

### 4. Market-Adjusted LSTM Forecast

- The LSTM forecast is further adjusted by applying a 15% annual growth rate, reflecting potential market influences.
- The adjusted forecast is plotted against the original LSTM and historical data.

### 5. Time Series Foundation Model (Transformer-like)

- A simulated Transformer-like model incorporates seasonality and growth factors for a more comprehensive forecast.
- The Transformer-like prediction is visualized against the baseline LSTM forecast and historical data.

## Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates applying different forecasting techniques to a time series dataset. Each method offers unique insights and potential for prediction.

**Note:** The Transformer-like model is a simulation and not an actual implementation of a Transformer network. It aims to illustrate the potential benefits of incorporating complex seasonal and growth patterns in forecasting.

## Further Exploration

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning model parameters (e.g., ARIMA order, LSTM layers) could improve forecast accuracy.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluating different models using metrics like RMSE or MAPE can help select the best-performing approach.
- **Feature Engineering:** Adding relevant external factors (e.g., economic indicators) could enhance forecast accuracy.
- **Real-world Deployment:** Integrating the chosen forecasting method into a production system for automated predictions.
